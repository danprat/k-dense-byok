# Architecture

This page explains how K-Dense BYOK runs on your computer. You do not need to read this to use the app - it is here if you are curious or troubleshooting.

## The three services

The `start.sh` script launches three local services that work together:

| Service | Port | What it does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| **Frontend** | 3000 | The web interface in your browser - chat, file browser, and file previews |
| **Backend** | 8000 | The "brain" - runs Kady, coordinates expert agents, manages your sandbox and files |
| **LiteLLM proxy** | 4000 | A translator that routes AI requests to the model you picked (via OpenRouter, Ollama, etc.) |

When you send a message:

1. The frontend passes it to the backend.
2. Kady (on the backend) decides whether to answer directly or delegate to an expert agent.
3. Any AI calls go through the LiteLLM proxy to the correct provider.
4. Responses stream back to your browser in real time.

## First-run setup

The first time you run `./start.sh`, it will automatically:

- Create a Python virtual environment in `.venv/`
- Install all Python dependencies
- Install Node.js dependencies for the frontend
- Install the Gemini CLI
- Download the scientific skills catalogue
- Run `uvx browser-use install` once to download a headless Chromium (used for browser automation)

Subsequent starts skip these steps via marker files and are much faster.

## A note on the expert model

The model you select in Kady's dropdown only applies to Kady (the main agent). When Kady delegates a task, the expert runs through the **Gemini CLI**, which always uses a Gemini model on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) regardless of your dropdown choice.

The one exception is local Ollama models - if you pick an Ollama model, both Kady and the expert run through your local daemon. See [Local models with Ollama](./local-models-ollama.md).
