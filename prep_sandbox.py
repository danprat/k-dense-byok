"""One-shot sandbox bootstrap for every known project.

Historically this script set up a single ``sandbox/`` folder. Now that each
project has its own isolated sandbox under ``projects/<id>/sandbox/``, this
script:

1. Migrates the legacy ``sandbox/`` + ``user_config/custom_mcps.json`` into
   ``projects/default/`` on first run (idempotent - no-op afterwards).
2. Runs the heavy sandbox init (copy GEMINI.md, merge Gemini settings,
   seed pyproject.toml, ``uv sync``, download scientific skills) for every
   non-archived project in the registry.

Running this is safe and idempotent; it can be re-invoked any time a new
dependency is added to the sandbox pyproject template.
